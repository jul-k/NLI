        <h2>Hiring process.</h2>
        <p>Let's admit that hiring process costs a lot of money, time and resources for your company and a cost of hiring a bad candidate is huge as well. What are the common problems?

- Your technical interviewer(s) asks wrong questions. Let's solve yet another one meaningless NP complete algorithmic problems? That does not work. You constantly lose a lot of good engineers during this process and it costs you money.

- Your candidate selection is not strict. You have a lot of engineers who have no clue what is the difference between websocket and socket? That's an another sign of that you constantly lose money.

What is the solution? Your hiring process should be automated with sophisticated unique questions from experts of different tech areas. That's what we do.</p>
